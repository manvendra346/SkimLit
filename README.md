# SkimLit
Many research papers have an abstract which gives us basic understanding about what the research paper is about. But it does not define what part of the abstract relates to what part of the paper that are objective , result, methods, conclusions .
 This is problem can be solved by using skimlit which is able to divide and lable the text of abstract with appropriate lable about what part of the paper does this text belong to.
This project replicates  the model which powers the PubMed 200k paper to classify different sequences in PubMed medical abstracts (which can help researchers read through medical abstracts faster) by Frank Dernoncourt, Ji Young Lee and is trained on over 200k medical research paper abstracts and is able to successfully label the part of abstracts to get an easy understanding of the whole paper.
